## Overwintering Your Pepper Plants

Many gardeners regard pepper plants as annuals. Yet these hard-working plants are perennials that, given the right conditions, will happily overwinter to next year. Overwintering pepper plants can be a little tricky, but keeping peppers over the winter is a great way to get a jump start on the new growing season, shortening the time to fruit production, extending the picking period and giving you an overall heavier harvest.

### How to Winter Peppers Indoors

> NOTE: If you plan on overwintering pepper plants, realize that doing this will keep the plant alive, but it will not produce fruit. 

The first step for how to keep peppers over winter is to bring them indoors before first frost. Before you do so, thoroughly spray the plant down including its roots. This will help to knock off any pests :bug: that may be hiding on the leaves or roots. Remove all pepper fruit, mature or immature, from the plant.

The next step for how to winter peppers indoors is to find a cool, dry location that receives minimal light to store the pepper plant — somewhere that remains well above freezing, around 13 C. (55 F.). An attached garage or a basement is ideal. This setting will force the plants into dormancy, meaning alive but not actively growing. They might look dead, but they are not. During this period of dormancy, you’ll want to make sure the soil doesn’t get too wet or too dry. Give the soil a nice spritzing every once and awhile so it stays lightly moist.

#### Watering Needs

Once you’ve placed the pepper plant in this location, cut back the watering. When you’re keeping peppers over the winter, you will find you need to water very infrequently as the plants begin to shut down in the lower light levels. You’ll only need to water the plant once every three to four weeks. Don’t let the soil stay soaked kist barely moist, but also don’t let it dry out completely. The potting mix should be left to get almost dry before watering.

Shortly after you place the pepper in a cool location and cut back watering, you will notice the leaves starting to die back :astonished:. This absolutely normal -- no need to panic. The pepper plant is entering dormancy. 

Once the leaves start to die, you can prune back the pepper plant, meaning trimming the plant to remove any injured or dead branches. Prune back the branches of the pepper plant to a few main “Y”s on the plant, leaving about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm.) for the upper part of the “Y”. This step in overwintering pepper plants will remove the dying leaves and make the plant less susceptible to pests. Some pepper plants will sit through the winter leafless, but will burst ito growth again with new branches in the spring.

#### Resurrecting Overwintered Peppers

To finish your pepper winter care, about a month and a half before your last :snowflake: frost date, bring your pepper plant out of the cool location and move it to a brighter, warmer location. You may even want to use a heating pad under the pot to add additional heat. Resume watering, but make sure not to overwater the pepper plant. In a week or so, you should see some new growth :leaves: appear. With the first signs of regrowth begin watering more often.  Plants can go out in to the greenhouse a week or two before the last frost date. You can always bring plants back indoors if an unusually cold night is forecast.

With improved light levels and rising temperatures it won’t be long before the leaves come thicker and faster and new branches develop. Once plants have begun to produce flower buds it’s time to begin feeding the peppers once more, with a liquid feed that’s high in potassium to encourage flowering and fruiting.

#### Final thoughts

That being said, even if you correctly follow all of the steps for how to keep peppers over winter, you may find that your pepper plant doesn’t survive :sob:. When overwintering pepper plants, some varieties will perform better than others. But, when keeping peppers over the winter works, you can enjoy your favorite peppers earlier in the season with a bit less work.
